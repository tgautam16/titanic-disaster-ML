# Titanic Disaster dataset

## In this project, I used different machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers based on various features in the dataset.

### The data-set was taken from Kaggle.

### Step 1
Identified the discrepency between male and female passengers survival rates. 
Looked at each feature independently 

### Step 2
Performed One-hot encoding, feature removal, feature scaling on the features of the data-set.

### Step 3
Trained four different machine learning models on the data-set: Logistic regression, Kernal SVM, Decision tree, Random forest.

### Step 4
Performed grid search and k-fold cross validation to estimate accuracy for each model in predicting the survival for test data

### Best performing model came out to be Random Forest with a mean accuracy score of 84%
